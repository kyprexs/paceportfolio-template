## üõ†Ô∏è How to Customize Your Portfolio

All your site's content (name, about, projects, skills, contact info, etc.) is in **`lib/siteConfig.ts`**.

```ts
export const siteConfig = {
  hero: {
    title: "Exploring The Universe Of",
    rotating: ["Web Development", "Full Stack Development", ...],
    subtitle: "Full-stack developer crafting stellar digital experiences..."
  },
  about: {
    name: "Cosmic Explorer",

    // ...
  },
  projects: [
    {
      title: "Nebula Dashboard",
      description: "A real-time analytics dashboard...",
      image: "/images/space.jpg",
      tags: ["React", "D3.js", "Firebase"]
    },
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
}
